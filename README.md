# AadhyaPath (PWA)

A single‑page crisis information and resilience app: view alerts, report incidents, find nearby resources, coordinate volunteers, and learn do's & don'ts.

## Quick start

- Open `landing.html` in your browser for the new first‑time experience, or serve locally:

```powershell
# Using Node.js
npx serve .

# Or using Python
python -m http.server 8000
```

Then visit `http://localhost:8000`.

Entry and auth flow
- Start at `landing.html` (informational landing)
- Choose `Create your account` to go to `auth.html?mode=signup` or `I already have an account` to go to `auth.html?mode=login`
- After signup/login, you will be redirected to `index.html` (dashboard). Direct access to the dashboard is gated.



## Features

- Multi-hazard alerts and filters (now includes slow-onset hazards: Air Pollution, Land Degradation, Sea Level Rise)
- Incident reporting and verification (demo data)
- Shelters/resources and map placeholders on Alerts and Report pages
- Volunteers and task assignment (demo)
- Do's & Don'ts with short videos
